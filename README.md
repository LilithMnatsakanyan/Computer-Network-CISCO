# Computer-Network-CISCO
Insurance company's computer network in the Cisco Packet Tracer environment.

## Introduction

This is my coursework for the third year of university. The coursework involves the design and implementation of a computer network for an insurance company in the Cisco Packet Tracer environment.

The project is based on the territory of Armenia. This company consists of five main offices—Yerevan, Charentsavan, Vedi, Aparan, and Vardenis—as well as 17 branches that serve customer needs across different regions of the republic.

### Computer Network
Almost every day you are faced with computer networks; for example, when you google something, shop online, or watch an interesting video on YouTube.
A computer network is a group of devices (e.g. a laptop, a computer, a printer, a mobile phone, a camera, etc.) to exchange data.
Devices can be combined in different ways, for example, using a wireless connection (WiFi, 3G/4G, Bluetooth) or physically, using a cable. Let's have a closer look at the examples.
#### WIRELESS CONNECTION
This is an example when a joint device is a WiFi router. By connecting a camera and a phone to the router, you can download photos from the camera to your phone. You can also chat with your friends by connecting your smartphone to 3G/4G mobile networks or run an online meeting by using a Bluetooth headset connected to your laptop.
#### WITH A CABLE
This is an example when the devices are physically connected (using a cable or a wire). Thus, you can connect a printer to your computer to send and print data.
### Computer Network Topology
Geometric representation of how computers are connected to each other is known as topology. Choosing the right topology type can increase performance and reduce risks. Also, it can increase energy and data efficiency which can in turn help to reduce operational and maintenance costs.
### OSI Model
How does a computer network work? For better understanding, let's have a closer look at what parts it consists of. The OSI model will help to understand this.
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model used to describe the constituent parts and the functions of a networking system.
The classic OSI model has 7 layers. 

7️⃣ Application Layer
6️⃣ Presentation Layer
5️⃣ Session Layer
4️⃣ Transport Layer
3️⃣ Network Layer
2️⃣ Data Link Layer
1️⃣ Physical Layer

This is the classic OSI model. It was developed in 1983. However, in practice, computer networks had been working even before this model was developed. And they worked slightly differently - using the TCP/IP stack.

### TCP/IP Model
The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model is a concise version of the OSI model.
It consists of 4 layers. In this model, compared to OSI, some layers are combined with each other. For example, the Application, Presentation, and Session layers are merged into the Application layer. The Physical layer from the OSI model is missing from the original TCP/IP model; however, it should be noted that there are other versions of the TCP/IP model and networking models in general. E.g., Andrew S. Tanenbaum adds the Physical layer to the four layers. 

4️⃣ Application Layer
3️⃣ Transport Layer
2️⃣ Internet Layer
1️⃣ Network Interface (Link) Layer

### Protocols
On each layer, certain protocols work.
In this way, on the Application layer we can use a browser. Here data is generated using the HTTP protocol. If we transfer files, then FTP (File transfer protocol) can be used. The data that we see on the page can be presented in multiple different formats: for example, illustrations in PNG format or lists in JSON format. To receive this data, the TCP or UDP protocol is used, which is responsible for transportation. If we look at the layer just below, we will see the protocols of network interactions. The IP protocol is responsible for addressing and routing across the network. Below is the Ethernet protocol. The last Physical layer can be directly occupied by the technology which enables you to connect to the network: DSL, Bluetooth, OTN.
### IP, DNS, URL
The Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications protocol for routing and addressing packets of data across a computer network. Its task is to deliver the packet from the source host to the destination host using only an IP address in the packet header.
While IP can be used to access information on the Internet, people most frequently use those domain names that could be easily memorized, like google.com. The Domain Name System (DNS) is basically the phonebook of the Internet. The purpose of DNS is to translate domain names to IP addresses. DNS resolution is a process of converting a hostname into an IP address.
A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), often called a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a protocol for retrieving it.
