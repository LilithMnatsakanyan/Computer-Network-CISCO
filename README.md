# **Computer Network Design for Insurance Company (Cisco Packet Tracer)**  

This project focuses on designing and implementing a computer network for an insurance company using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It serves as coursework for my third year of university and is based on the territory of **Armenia**.  

The project involves **five main offices** in Yerevan, Charentsavan, Vedi, Aparan, and Vardenis, along with **17 branches** that cater to customer needs across the country. A visual slideshow is also available to better illustrate the design and implementation process of the network.

## **üîß Computer Network Design**  

### **What is a Computer Network?**  
A **computer network** is a system of interconnected devices (e.g., laptops, printers, smartphones, etc.) that exchange data. Networks can be connected in various ways, either **wirelessly** or **physically**.  

#### **Wireless Connection**  
- **Example**: A WiFi router connects a camera and phone, allowing photo transfers.  
- Mobile devices use 3G/4G networks for internet browsing or online meetings via Bluetooth headsets.  

#### **Wired Connection**  
- Devices can be physically connected via cables, such as connecting a printer to a computer to print data.

## **üñß Network Topology**  

**Topology** refers to the geometric arrangement of computers in a network. The choice of topology directly impacts performance, risk management, energy efficiency, and data transfer, helping to reduce **operational and maintenance costs**.

## **üìê OSI Model**  

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model** is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers:

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Application Layer**  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Presentation Layer**  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Session Layer**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Transport Layer**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Network Layer**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Link Layer**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Physical Layer**  

This model, developed in 1983, helps explain the structure of communication in computer networks, but **TCP/IP** has been the primary model for networking since its inception.

## **üì¶ TCP/IP Model**  

The **TCP/IP Model** is a simplified version of the OSI Model with **4 layers**:

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Application Layer**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Transport Layer**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Internet Layer**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Network Interface (Link) Layer**  

In the TCP/IP model, some layers from the OSI model are merged (e.g., Application, Presentation, and Session layers into the **Application layer**).

## **‚öôÔ∏è Network Protocols**  

Each layer in the OSI/TCP/IP model uses specific protocols to perform various functions:

- **Application Layer**: Protocols like **HTTP** (for browsing) and **FTP** (for file transfer).  
- **Transport Layer**: Protocols such as **TCP** and **UDP** for data transport.  
- **Network Layer**: **IP** (for addressing and routing).  
- **Data Link Layer**: **Ethernet** for network interactions.  
- **Physical Layer**: Technologies like **DSL**, **Bluetooth**, or **OTN** for physical network connections.

## **üåê IP, DNS, and URL**  

### **Internet Protocol (IP)**  
The **IP** protocol is responsible for routing packets across the network, delivering data from the source to the destination using IP addresses in packet headers.

### **Domain Name System (DNS)**  
DNS translates **human-readable domain names** (like **google.com**) into **IP addresses**, acting as the "phonebook" of the Internet.  

### **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**  
A **URL** is a web address that identifies the location of a resource on the Internet and the protocol used to retrieve it.

## **üì∏ Visual Slideshow**  

To further illustrate the network design and its components, a **slideshow** has been created. It visually shows the steps of implementing the network, from planning to final deployment. You can refer to this slideshow for an easy-to-understand view of the work done.
